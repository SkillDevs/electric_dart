## 0.7.1

* A DevTools extension for Electric is now included to check the status of the Electric service, inspect the electrified tables and check the status of the shape subscriptions.
To know more about DevTools and how to run them on your IDE you can check these resources: [DevTools](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/overview) and [DevTools extensions](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/extensions).


## 0.7.0

* Code based on official Typescript client [v0.11.0](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/releases/tag/electric-sql%400.11.0), [v0.11.1](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/releases/tag/electric-sql%400.11.1), [v0.11.2](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/releases/tag/electric-sql%400.11.2) and [v0.11.3](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/releases/tag/electric-sql%400.11.3).
* Support for using Electric with Postgres on the client. This would be a way of syncing 2 different Postgres databases, one on the client and the main one on the Electric service. You can see an example on the todos app in the `../drift/connection/native.dart` file. Right now this only works on a Dart io platform using a "real" Postgres database. If we ever get a [`PGLite`](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite) equivalent for Dart, it would be automatically supported.
* **BREAKING**: The `electrify` function now takes a parameter `ElectricMigrations` instead of `List<Migration>`, also autogenerated by the CLI.
* Add a escape hatch method `syncTableRaw` to allow creating a shape subscription manually, without the `drift` API. Using `syncTable` is still recommended.
* Fix error when the websocket close code or reason are null.


## 0.6.0

* Code based on official Typescript client [v0.10.0](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/releases/tag/electric-sql%400.10.0) and [v0.10.1](https://github.com/electric-sql/electric/releases/tag/electric-sql%400.10.1).
* **BREAKING**: Compatible with the Electric service v0.10.0+
* **BREAKING**: The `syncTables` function has been removed in favor of the new [Shapes](https://electric-sql.com/docs/usage/data-access/shapes) feature and the function `syncTable`, which can be customized with `WHERE` clauses or to include other related tables. More information in the README.
* **BREAKING**: DateTimes obtained for the Postgres types TIME, TIMESTAMP and DATE are now always in UTC. These types don't store timezone information, so for consistency they are in UTC when reading. For example, if you insert "2023-01-15 08:30" (local), "2023-01-15 08:30+00" (UTC) or "2023-01-15 08:30-05" (with offset); timezone is stripped and all of them will be read as "2023-01-15 08:30" (UTC). 
* **BREAKING**: Now the `ElectricClient` class has a generic type with the type of the drift database (`ElectricClient<AppDatabase>`), to improve type safety and integration.
* Improved type mapping between a Postgres database and the drift Electric client in a Dart backend.
