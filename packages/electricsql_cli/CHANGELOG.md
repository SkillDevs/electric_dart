## 0.3.0

* [BREAKING CHANGE]: The `generate_migrations` command is now called `generate` and it will also generate the drift schema code automatically based on the Postgres schema.
This means that is no longer required to replicate the schema in drift manually with the same table and column names as the Postgres schema, making the process much simpler.
